# 2. Sync with latest develop changes
git fetch origin develop
git merge origin/develop

# Example for Ayton:
git checkout Ayton
git pull origin Ayton
git merge origin/develop
```

### **During Development**
```bash
# Commit frequently with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat(data-api): implement user data retrieval endpoint

- Add GET /api/users/{id} endpoint
- Implement data validation
- Add error handling for invalid user IDs
- Update API documentation"

# Push your work regularly to your personal branch
git push origin [YourName]

# Example for Lebron:
git push origin Lebron
```

### **End of Day (6:00 PM)**
```bash
# Always push your work before leaving
git add .
git commit -m "wip: end of day commit - [brief description]"
git push origin [YourName]

# Example for Ayton:
